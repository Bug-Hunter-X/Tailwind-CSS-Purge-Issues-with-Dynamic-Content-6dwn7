This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js where the CSS isn't being applied correctly to dynamically generated content.  The problem is that Tailwind's purge feature may not be correctly identifying and including the classes used in components rendered after the initial page load. This usually manifests as some UI elements not being styled as expected.
